			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<h3>The TL;DR:</h3>
			<p>We only use the information necessary to handle web
			requests and provide the appropriate responses, and we
			do not store your data. Where your handler preferences
			are concerned, you store those and send them to us when
			you visit us.</p>
			<h3>Data we collect when you use our services</h3>
			<p>As part of browsing or using our services, we must
			collect the following data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your IP address.</li>
				<li>Your preferences as to which handler to use
					for a given protocol.</li>
				<li>The refering site.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your web browser may send additional data which we
			ignore.</p>
			<p>We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying
			information (number of requests, number of errors,
			server load, and similar, per time interval) to
			operate, imprive, and optimize our service.</p>
			<h4>How we use this data</h4>
			<p>We use your data for the following purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We use your IP address to grant you access
					to the requested pages.</li>
				<li>We use your preferences as to which handler
					to use for a given protocol, to direct
					you to the correct handler.</li>
				<li>We use the refering site to protect you
					from unauthorized changes to your
					handler preferences.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We do not store your data. Your preferences are
			stored with you.</p>
			<p>We do not process your data beyond as stated
			here.</p>
			<h3>Links and redirects to third parties</h3>
			<p>As part of providing our services, we may link or
			redirect you to third parties. When visiting third
			parties you are subject to their privacy policies
			instead of ours.</p>
			<p>We recommend installing a content blocker, for
			example uBlock Origin, and configuring it so as to
			block any third parties you may not want to provide
			your data to, if desired.</p>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>We use cookies to enable you to store and send us
			your handler preferences.</p>
			<p>A cookie is a small piece of text that our web
			server can request your browser to store, which your
			browser sends to us when you return to our site. These
			do not necessarily identify you; however, your
			particular handler preferences may be unique among all
			users, which would allow identification. By opting to
			save your handler preferences, you agree that we can
			place these types of cookies on your computer or
			device. You may disable your browser or device's
			ability to accept or store cookies, in which case you
			will not be able to save handler preferences.</p>
			<h3>Securing your information</h3>
			<p><i>this doesn't apply to the demo. [FIXME remove
				this line when we go live]</i></p>
			<p>We encrypt your information when you send it to us,
			using industry-standard TLS. We do not store your
			information.</p>
			<p>No method of transmission is 100% secure. Should we
			find your information has leaked, we will let you know
			through the channels we have available. These include,
			but are not limited to, our website, and our social
			media accounts.</p>
			<p>If you're concerned about your handler preferences,
			consider using an anti-malware and/or backup software,
			but it is not of our responsibility as we do not store
			it.</p>
			<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
			Material changes will be posted through the channels we
			have available, at least 30 days prior to the change
			taking effect.</p>
			<h3>GDPR compliance</h3>
			<p>This app is not GDPR compliant. If you're an EU
			natural person and you wanna use this app, go fuck
			yourself. This app does not knowingly process personal
			information of EU natural persons. This app's budget is
			$18/year and unless you can honestly explain how
			increasing that budget 25-fold just to get an EU
			representative (not to be confused with a DPO) isn't
			the most classist and xenomisic legal requirement ever,
			this is not gonna change. (And yes, that is genuinely
			the only reason this app isn't GDPR compliant.)</p>
