			<h2>What is Fedi-To?</h2>
			<p>Fedi-To is primarily a one-way bridge between
			Mastodon and the wider fediverse and fediverse apps.
			As a side-effect, this also makes it an effective
			privacy tool: you no longer need to hand your instance's
			domain to random Mastodon instances. It is also the
			best way to open FediText from a Mastodon remote
			interaction dialog.</p>
			<h2>Using Fedi-To</h2>
			<p>Simply type <code>fedi-to.net</code> into the remote
			interaction dialog and (if you have set everything up
			correctly) your mastodon client, e.g. FediText, should
			open!</p>
			<h2>Is there more to it?</h2>
			<p>Yes! Fedi-To also implements compatibility layers
			with a handful of web-based client software. This loses
			some of the privacy benefits, but is the easiest way
			to use these clients. The following clients are
			currently supported, simply click one of the links and
			proceed to activation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/register?protocol=web%2Bap&amp;h=4">The Elk client at elk.zone</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Further, Fedi-To is not limited to just
			ActivityPub/Mastodon. If you're a developer and you have
			a project in mind involving decentralized https-based
			protocols, we highly encourage you to contact us via
			ActivityPub through <code>@SoniEx2@chaos.social</code>.</p>
