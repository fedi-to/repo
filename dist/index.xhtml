			<p>Fedi-To is attempting to redefine Web-based Protocol
			Handlers, by both making them a Web-first system and
			bringing them to mobile. Fedi-To helps handle
			<code>web+</code> protocols while providing an improved
			user experience.</p>
			<p>It is our hope that by launching this service, we
			can show how Web Protocol Handlers can significantly
			improve the web.</p>
			<p>The current pilot includes only a handful of
			handlers; wide availability is still being worked
			on. However, support for <code>/.well-known</code>
			should be coming soon.</p>
