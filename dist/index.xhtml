			<h2>Why Fedi-To?</h2>
			<p>Fedi-To is a service designed for bloggers, by
			bloggers, who also use Mastodon or other "fediverse"
			apps. It allows us to link to such apps, while having
			the links preferentially open in the reader's app. This
			allows the reader to immediately interact with the
			fediverse content.</p>
			<p>Centralized social media allows the reader to
			immediately interact with the content, coming from
			an external source. This creates a "click blackhole"
			effect, which drives up engagement on the platform,
			helping to keep users around. But
			traditionally, federated social media has mostly been
			a "click sprawler", where you click out of it and never
			come back, precisely because it doesn't have this
			"return path".</p>
			<p>If centralized social media didn't support immediate
			engagement from returning users, it'd also lose users
			over time. In other words, it's important to keep a
			balance between "users leaving your network" and "users
			returning to your network". Fedi-To creates that return
			path for federated networks, allowing them not just to
			survive but also to thrive.</p>
			<h2>Using Fedi-To</h2>
			<p>If you're an user of federated apps, check with your
			instance admin for Fedi-To support! You may be able to
			set it up so Fedi-To links open in your instance!</p>
			<p>If you're a blogger, the Fedi-To API documentation
			shows how to make Fedi-To URLs you can put in your
			posts.</p>
			<p>If you're a federated app developer, the
			<a href="https://fedi-to.github.io/protocol-handler.html">protocol-handler</a>
			specification provides instructions for how to implement
			Web-First Protocol Handlers.</p>
			<p>If you're an instance admin, feel free to get in
			touch! The preferred way for this is the GitHub.</p>
			<h2>About Fedi-To</h2>
			<p>Fedi-To is attempting to redefine Web-based Protocol
			Handlers, by both making them a Web-first system and
			bringing them to mobile. Fedi-To helps handle
			<code>web+</code> protocols while providing an improved
			user experience. It is our hope that by making this
			service, we can show how Web Protocol Handlers can
			significantly improve the web.</p>
			<p>The current pilot includes only a handful of
			handlers; wide availability is still being worked
			on. However, we also support
			<code>/.well-known/protocol-handler</code>, which
			allows anyone to provide Fedi-To compatibility
			while also providing a more useful fallback than the
			built-in handlers. Check out
			<a href="https://fedi-to.github.io/">our Open Source
			Collaboration Space on GitHub</a> for more information
			on specifications, including how to participate, and
			Fedi-To API documentation.</p>
