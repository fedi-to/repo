			<h2>Why Fedi-To?</h2>
			<p>Fedi-To allows fediverse links shared outside the
			fedi to still open in the user's fediverse app. This
			allows immediate interaction and is the perfect tool
			for folks who want to go viral on fedi. It completely
			evades the copy-and-paste bullshit that Mastodon tries
			so hard to promote!</p>
			<h2>Using Fedi-To</h2>
			<p>If you're an user of federated apps, check with your
			instance admin for Fedi-To support! You may be able to
			set it up so Fedi-To links open in your instance!</p>
			<p>If you're a blogger, the Fedi-To API documentation
			shows how to make Fedi-To URLs you can put in your
			posts.</p>
			<p>If you're a federated app developer, the
			<a href="https://fedi-to.github.io/protocol-handler.html">protocol-handler</a>
			specification provides instructions for how to implement
			Web-First Protocol Handlers.</p>
			<p>If you're an instance admin, feel free to get in
			touch! The preferred way for this is the GitHub.</p>
			<h2>About Fedi-To</h2>
			<p>Fedi-To is attempting to redefine Web-based Protocol
			Handlers, by both making them a Web-first system and
			bringing them to mobile. Fedi-To helps handle
			<code>web+</code> protocols while providing an improved
			user experience. It is our hope that by making this
			service, we can show how Web Protocol Handlers can
			significantly improve the web.</p>
			<p>The current pilot includes only a handful of
			handlers; wide availability is still being worked
			on. However, we also support
			<code>/.well-known/protocol-handler</code>, which
			allows anyone to provide Fedi-To compatibility
			while also providing a more useful fallback than the
			built-in handlers. Check out
			<a href="https://fedi-to.github.io/">our Open Source
			Collaboration Space on GitHub</a> for more information
			on specifications, including how to participate, and
			Fedi-To API documentation.</p>
